# ugetools

This repository contains scripts for interacting with Broad UGE implementations, including tools and resources for:

* UGE_MONITORING: monitoring your counts of running and queued jobs in the context of the other running jobs on the cluster.

* UGE_SUBMISSIONS: simplifying batched execution of commands and tracking success/failure

* UGE_CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT: tracking down misbehaving or unresponsive nodes in the cluster.
