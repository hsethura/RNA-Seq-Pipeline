Thank you for initiating a project at the Microbial Omics Core.  Your project has been assigned the unique ID UNIQID.

The link at the bottom of this message will take you to your project directory on Google Drive that includes a keyfile and a summary of your project (also attached to this email). 

It also includes a directory in which to upload QC file and reference sequences and annotations (if needed).

To ensure your project can be processed please complete the following steps as quickly as possible:
